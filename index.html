   <p>If you are reading this page then the supposition is made that you are familiar with GitHub, the web-based source code repository. Additionally, if you are reading this page, the supposition is made that you, like myself, have harbored embarassment about not being able to seemlessly operate, and often been confused by, a simple looking GUI that evokes Facebook with a silhouette of Felix the Cat occupying the space of the block-F logo. And seriously, have you ever met anybody who was 'confused' on how to operate Facebook??? Me neither.</p> 
    <p>However, after a little more than 2 consecutive weeks of using GitHub to store and edit my files, I have developed a simple workflow that works well for me, one that I feel will work well for you as well, if Git is something relatively new to you. Therefore, I have decided to share my experience through this post, as it probably will eliminate any feelings of confusion you may be experiencing using this valuable web tool and start to clear up the bigger picture of how it can fit into your web-dev skill set. By no means am I an expert on all things GitHub, but after a couple of weeks of learning the hard way from my mistakes using the software, I think this blog will be of use to those of you who are new to and presently uncomfortable with using GitHub.</p>
    <p>I was introduced to GitHub through the 'Intro to Front End Development Class' I was taking at Austin Coding Academy back in the Summer of 2015. Prior to this I had no experience with it, and up until a few weeks ago my only experience with it (outside of viewing somebody elses files) was from that class, which predominantly consisted on collaborating with a partner on a simple homework assignment through back and forth submittals of code through GitHub. I wouldn't describe it as a pleasant experience as although the graphic interface looked 'simple', I felt like it was anything but, and I was growing increasingly frustrated at how something that <italic>looked</italic>so simple to use could give me that much trouble to understand what was going on. So much so that I advoided using the service alltogether for the next 6 months. However, I eventually made a return to it and have begun to actively endorse it to others, triggered by multiple faux pas I made trying to merge edits into a single file after creating and editing multiple copies of parent file (Ex. wasting hours perplexed as to why my html page was not responding to changes in css styling when the problem was the wrong file paths were being linked after the edits were made in a duplicate file that was edited and renamed.</p>
    <p>Therefore, to me, this is one of the huge benefits of using GitHub, and doing so can save you a lot of time and often times frustration and embarassment, as GitHub allows you to compartmentalize your edits to your files, allowing a copy of your original files to remain independent of and intact from any editing, later providing you the option to either accept or reject these edits at a later time. Furthermore, because Git keeps a log to track the accumulation of edits and consequent evolution of documents over time, it also provides the option to 'get in the DeLorean' and retrieve an earlier version of the document from an earlier stage in its respective life, reverting any subsequent edits that were merged into the file afterward. So, all that stated in a different way means this: you don't have to subscribe to the the "if it's not broke don't fix it" approach to file editing and if you files go humpty dumpty you can always put them back together again.</p>
